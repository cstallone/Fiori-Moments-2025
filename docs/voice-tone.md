# Voice & Tone

## SAP Fiori Personality


The style, voice, and tone of the messages and illustrations in our library are determined by the Fiori personality. To understand the Fiori personality, you need to understand its underlying attributes: **Relatable, Smart, Encouraging,** and **Trusted**. They’re derived from SAP’s core values, mission, and tone of voice. By embracing these attributes, you positively shape the way users feel about SAP and interact with our products.

## SAP Fiori Voice & Tone

Voice and tone go hand-in-hand and are often used interchangeably, but they’re distinct ideas that are worth noting: The way of expressing the personality of the product. To connect with our customers, it’s best to talk in a way that resonates with them. Every piece of writing on a page (from body copy to button labels) contributes to the voice and tone you’re using to speak to our users.

Voice is part of our Fiori personality. Tone is the mood. Our personality is consistent and established. The tone should vary according to the situation and audience. Use the following guidelines to apply the right voice and choose the correct tone.

##### **Voice**

Voice is determined by the SAP Fiori UX personality attributes that we’ve just described: **Relatable, Smart, Encouraging,** and **Trusted**. When your voice is aligned with these attributes, you help empower users to meet their business goals. If your voice is inconsistent, people notice and lose trust.

Take a look at the following example. In applying the attribute Relatable to our writing style, we’ve considered the user’s perspective and eliminated jargon, while explaining things simply and directly.

<div class="plainCards"><i class="icon-check2 mr-2 text-green fs-24"></i><strong>Do</strong></div>

<plainCard title="" description="You successfully joined our community." />

<div class="plainCards"><i class="icon-close mr-1 text-red fs-24"></i><strong>Don't</strong></div>

<plainCard title="" description="Application successfully processed your join request." />
<br />

##### **Tone**
While voice is always consistent, tone can vary according to situation and audience. Tone is the mood or feeling you present to the user. For example, new end users like encouragement and the occasional “You did it! Good job.” Expert users, not so much. They prefer you’re more to the point.

So first identify who you’re talking to and use the tone that meets the expectations and needs of that audience. Make the audience feel that you get them. Your tone should never feel complex or distant. Rather, it should always feel **Relatable, Smart, Encouraging,** and **Trusted.**

Depending on the situation and audience, your tone may be less formal and more familiar (we call this *Business Casual Tone*) or more direct and less casual (we call this *Professional Tone*).

<br />

##### **Business Casual Tone**

This tone is a good choice for new or occasional users, especially if they don’t feel comfortable with the task at hand. It can also be a good choice for mobile users.

To put the user at ease, use natural, everyday language with a friendly, upbeat tone. This conversational and relaxed style makes it easier for users to understand what you’re asking of them and encourages them to engage with the feature. Address the user directly with “you” where appropriate. Use contractions like “we’re” and “let’s” where they fit the context and improve flow. Contractions like this reassure users that they’re not on their own. Be supportive and encouraging, but clear and concise, not chatty.

Here's an example of a message in business casual tone where the user hasn’t yet performed a search:

<plainCard title="Let’s get some results" description="Start by providing your search criteria." />

Notice how this example puts a positive spin on an empty state: “Let’s get some results”. The message focuses on the user’s goal and avoids unnecessary and redundant information. Did you spot the contraction “Let’s”? It reassures the user that we’ll help them, and invites the user to continue.

<Article description="Although business casual tone is more relaxed, be sure to observe proper grammar and writing principles. You should always create a favorable impression. It may help to think of business casual tone as wearing a suit without a tie. It should be accessible and approachable, while still respectful." />

<br />

##### **Professional Tone**

This tone is a good choice for users whose tasks are more serious in nature or for users who need little or no handholding. They may include developers, consultants, and administrators.

With this tone, be more direct and to the point. You should still be conversational, but less informal. If your tone is too informal, you may lose your target audience’s interest and attention. It may also give a negative impression of your level of expertise.

Here’s an example of an error message in professional tone where the user is unable to upload content:

<plainCard title="Unable to upload" description="Check your internet connection. If that’s not it, check the file format and file size. Otherwise contact your administrator. " />

Notice how clearly and concisely the text communicates the issue, and tells the user what to do. Notice also how the message is careful not to blame the user. We never want the user to feel at fault.

For comparison, here’s the same use case in business casual tone:

<plainCard title="Looks like we can't upload " description="Check your internet connection. If that’s not it, make sure the file format is supported and the file size isn’t too large. If that still doesn’t help, contact your administrator." />

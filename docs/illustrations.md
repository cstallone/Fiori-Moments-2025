# About Illustrations

## Overview
Illustrations are a powerful communication tool. They convey an idea visually, and help to create an emotional connection between end users and our products. We’ve taken the qualities of our SAP Fiori personality and translated them into a distinctive illustration style that is true to our tone of voice.

<br />

Illustrations offer the following advantages:
<ul><li> Help users to understand a concept quickly</li>
<li> Make complex ideas more relatable </li>
<li> Express our personality and tone of voice </li>
<li> Provide consistency across products </li>
</ul>

## Usage

Use an illustration paired with a written message to help clarify empty and success states and communicate next steps. It’s a great way to add personality, convey meaning, and add visual interest. You can find recommended pairings of illustrations and messages, as well as the code to easily implement them, in the Use Case Library for Empty States and Use Case Library for Success States. We’ve been careful to make sure the illustrations have the right tone for the situation.

## Illustration Principles

<illustrationsCard img="13a-Helpful@2x.png" alt="Helpful" title="Helpful" description="Our illustrations help users to better understand a concept or situation in a visual way. They are meant to clarify, not steal the spotlight. <br /><br /> Stylistically, they are simple and light, complementing the surrounding UI and color palette. They should never distract the user from getting their work done." />

<illustrationsCard img="13b-Relatable@2x.png" alt="Relatable" title="Relatable" description="We want to show that we are empathetic and value our users. Our illustrations strive to be inclusive, so that users of all ages, races, genders, and types understand and connect with the message. <br /><br />
Our illustrations use lines and symbols to express emotion and suggest movement. Their style is more organic and approachable. They help us tell stories that people can relate to. " />

<illustrationsCard img="13c-Clear@2x.png" alt="Clear" title="Clear" description="Our illustrations visually reinforce the messages. <br /> <br /> We avoid telling more than one story in an illustration and try to be as direct and literal as possible. When appropriate, we use a metaphor to help convey more complex concepts and engage the user. " />

## Illustration Style

##### **Color Palette**

The color palette was chosen carefully with theming in mind. It’s based on the SAP Fiori primary colors to complement the Fiori UI and maintain consistency across applications. For visual interest, we included SAP gold as an accent color—a nod to our corporate brand. If you create an illustration yourself, start by downloading our Adobe Illustrator Graphic Style.

<img src="./.vuepress/public/15-Color-palette.png" alt="Color Palette"/>

<br /><br />
<Article description="See also the <a href='https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/GDD/Fiori+Moments+Illustration+Specification'>UX illustrations for SAP Fiori Visual Design Spec</a> and <a href='https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2017196009#CrossTechnologyThemeParameters(Quartz)-SemanticColors'>Cross Technology Theme Parameters (Quartz)</a> wiki for UI5. We’ve calculated the theme parameters for dark theme and high contrast white (HCW)/high contrast black (HCB), also shown in the wiki." />

<br />
<br />

##### **Color Usage**

We generally refrain from using too much color in our illustrations. Color is great, but we’re selective about how and when it’s used. The illustrations should complement the UI, not draw too much attention to themselves. We use neutral colors as the majority color, and tints of brand color and the accent color gold to highlight certain elements in our illustrations.

<TableCards img1="15a-Color-Usage-Do@2x.png" alt1="Usuage Do" description1="Use neutral colors as the majority color." img2="15b-Color-Usage-Don't@2x.png" alt2="Color-Usage Dont" description2="Don’t use brand color or accent color as the majority color as it will draw too much attention."/>

<br />
<br />

##### **Flat vs Gradient Color**

Gradients are not used in our illustrations since our illustration style is not aiming for a realistic approach.

<TableCards img1="16-Flat-vs-Gradient-Do@2x.png" alt1="Gradient Do" description1="Use flat colors in illustrations." img2="16-Flat-vs-Gradient-Don't@2x.png" alt2="Gradient Dont" description2="Don’t use brand color or accent color as the majority color as it will draw too much attention."/>

<br />

<br />

##### **Background Shapes**

Background shapes are used as grounding in our dialog and scene illustrations. If you create a modal or scene illustration yourself, get the <a href="http://backgroundkit.ai/">Adobe Illustrator Background Kit</a> and use our background shapes as your starting point. The backgrounds help to seat larger illustrations within the UI. They are always rounded and abstract. Feel free to modify them to fit your illustrations better. We suggest using #e7e9ea as the background shape color since it works well against various backgrounds.

<Article description="Do not use background shapes for spot illustrations." />

<br />

##### **Stroke Color**

#4a5055 is used for stroke color; alternatively the lighter shades #c6cace or #9da4aa for complex objects or accent elements.

<img src="./.vuepress/public/17-Stroke-Color@2x.png" alt="Stroke color"/>


<br /><br />

##### **Stroke Weight**

We use 1px stroke weight in all of our illustrations. It works well in various sizes and allows us to create px-perfect assets.
<br />

<TableCards img1="18-Stroke-Weight-Do@2x.png" alt1="Stroke Do" description1="Use a 1px stroke in illustrations." img2="18-Stroke-Weight-Don't@2x.png" alt2="Stroke Dont" description2="Don’t use strokes that are thicker or thinner than 1px in illustrations."/>

<br />
<br />

##### **Stroke Cap & Corner**

Our illustrations have rounded cap and rounded corners. They make the illustrations appear friendlier and more approachable.

<TableCards img1="19-Stroke-Cap-Do@2x.png" alt1="Stroke cap Do" description1="Use rounded cap and rounded corners." img2="19-Stroke-Cap-Don't@2x.png" alt2="Stroke Dont" description2="Don’t use cap and corners that aren’t rounded."/>

<br />
<br />

##### **Corner Radius**
Corner radius is normally 1px. If you create an illustration yourself, it's okay to use your own judgment to decide on the radius when it comes to smaller objects.

<br />

<br />

##### **Patterns**

Patterns add an interesting and distinctive touch to our illustrations. If you create an illustration yourself, apply them as a highlight or shadow to indicate depth. Start by downloading the [Adobe Illustrator Graphic Style]() and use as color and pattern swatches.

Patterns are never used as a primary focus—and we’re mindful not to overuse them. For example, we don’t use highlight and shadow patterns on the same area, since this would make the illustration look very busy. Also, we don’t use patterns on every object in a scene illustration because it would be overpowering.

<br />

<TableCards img1="21-Pattern-Do@2x.png" alt1="Pattern Do" description1="Use patterns as an interesting touch, but be mindful not to overuse them." img2="21-Pattern-Don't@2x.png" alt2="Pattern Dont" description2="Don’t use patterns as a primary focus or use highlight and shadow patterns in the same area."/>

<br />

<br />

##### **Perspective**

The point of view in our illustrations is from the front or top. We avoid creating objects in perspective or in isometric view.

<TableCards img1="22-Perspective-Do@2x.png" alt1="Perspective Do" description1="Use front or top view." img2="22-Perspective-Don't@2x.png" alt2="Perspective Dont" description2="Don’t create objects in perspective or isometric view."/>

<br />
<br />

##### **Light Source**

If you create an illustration yourself, imagine the light is coming from your top left. Use highlight dotted patterns in #ffffff to indicate the light source.

<br />

##### **Shadows**

Filled shapes in #4a5055 or shadow dotted patterns in #0a6ed1 are used to indicate shadows.

<br />

<br />

##### **How We Illustrate Things**
**To Indicate Ground/Floor** <br />
Lines (1px, #4a5055) are used to indicate ground.

**To Indicate Things That Are Floating** <br />
A light gray (#e7e9ea) oval shape is used to indicate the shadow when an object is floating.

**To Add a Human Aspect to Illustrations** <br />
Sometimes, it’s appropriate to include people in an illustration to build an immediate connection with users. To remain inclusive, we use hands or legs instead of a face or full body. Users should be able to relate to the illustrations, no matter their ethnicity, gender, or age.

**Level of Detail** <br />
If objects are too abstract, people will have difficulty understanding them. Conversely, if objects are too detailed, they will appear too busy.


<threeColumnCard img1="26a-Level_of_detail@2x.png" alt1="Level of detail1" description1="<strong>Too Simple/Abstract</strong> <br /> With too little detail, the object may be hard to recognize." img2="26b-Level_of_detail@2x.png" alt2="Level of detail2" description2="<strong>Just Right</strong> <br />By adding a few windows and doors, it’s more obvious that they are buildings." addCard="3" img3="26c-Level_of_detail@2x.png" alt3="Level of detail3" description3="<strong>Too Complex</strong> <br />Adding too many details makes the illustration too busy." />

## Creating Your Own Illustrations

Before designing your own illustration, check to see if we have the use case you are looking for. You can find recommended pairings of illustrations and messages in our [Use Case Library for Empty States](/empty-states.html#use-case-library) and [Use Case Library for Success States](/success-states.html#use-case-library). Also check our [Component Status](/status.html) page to see what designs we have in the pipeline.

<br />

##### **Contribution Process**

If you don’t find what you need, you can create your own illustrations. It may not be easy, but it’s a lot of fun! Before using your illustration, send it to <a href='mailto:cara.stallone@sap.com'>Cara Stallone</a> and start the review process to ensure it meets our consistency guidelines. Once your illustration is accepted, we’ll add it to our illustration library and prepare it for use on our platform.

<br />

##### **Getting Started**

Make sure the message for the empty state or success state is finalized. You don’t want to create an illustration, only to find that the message has since changed.

Familiarize yourself with our [illustration style](/illustrations.html#illustration-style). Choose the subject of your illustration for the empty state or success state very carefully. It should enhance the accompanying message in a pleasant and descriptive way. If it doesn’t add anything to the message, skip it. For more information about messaging, see [Voice & Tone](/voice-tone.html).

Be mindful of the context for your illustration. For example, if the message is *You’ve no new mail*, it’s best to anchor your illustration with a globally relevant image such as an envelope symbol.


<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;">
<img src="./.vuepress/public/14-No-mail@2x.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Illustration with globally relevant image"/>
</div>

*<p class="text-center">Illustration with globally relevant image</p>*

For spot and dialog illustrations, a good rule of thumb is to be more literal to the meaning you want to convey. Scene illustrations can be more conceptual and tell more of a story, if you desire.

<Article description="Never use an illustration taken from the internet or any other external source, as the illustrations may be protected, for example, under copyright. Even if they are not protected now, this could change. Also, it’s important for the illustrations in SAP applications to match our illustration style and sizing to ensure consistency. " />

<br />
<br />

##### **Cultural Considerations**

Illustrations can inform and delight, but only if the audience can understand the image and relate to it. With users in different parts of the world, and from different cultural backgrounds, it can be challenging to create an illustration that works for a broader, global audience. Here are some tips for success.

**Keep the design minimal** <br />
To help ensure that you present a clear narrative that won’t be disrupted by elements that have different meanings in different cultures, use a minimal design.

**Take care with symbols and landmarks** <br />
Be careful with symbols that may not be perceived the same way from country to country. For example, the thumbs-up gesture is commonly used in many cultures to signify a job well done, but is considered offensive in several countries in West Africa and the Middle East. An owl is associated with wisdom in most Western countries, but pessimism in Arabic-speaking ones.

Keep in mind that landmarks may not be recognizable worldwide.

<threeColumnCard img1="27a-Traditional_Architecture@2x.png" alt1="Traditional architecture" description1="<i>Traditional architecture found only in parts of Europe </i>" img2="27b-Typical_Architecture@2x.png" alt2="Typical Architecture" description2="<i>Typical architecture found across the world</i>" />

<br />
<br />

**Use our color palette** <br />
Some colors have negative, political, or mixed connotations in some cultures. For example, in the United States, green often represents eco-friendliness, but it can also signal greed. In Eastern cultures, green can even indicate infidelity. In Western cultures, red is associated with danger, whereas in Asian cultures, it’s associated with luck, joy, and celebration. To avoid potential pitfalls, use only our color palette.

<threeColumnCard img1="28a-Western_cuture_stop_sign@2x.png" alt1="Western cultures" description1="<i>In Western cultures, red is associated with danger </i>" img2="28b-Asian_culture_red_envelop@2x.png" alt2="Asian Culture" description2="<i>In Asian cultures, red is associated with luck, joy, and celebration</i>" />

<br />
<br />

**Use text only in the message** <br />
The translation tools are unable to translate text that is part of an image. Text belongs only in the message, not in the illustration.

<threeColumnCard img1="29a-Word_in_image@2x.png" alt1="Success" img2="29b-Word_in_image@2x.png" alt2="Asian Culture" />

*<p class="text-center">The word “Success” couldn’t be translated because it is part of the image (right)</p>*

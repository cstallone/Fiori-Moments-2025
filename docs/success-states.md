# Success States
## Overview

Success states are occasions to celebrate and reward a user’s special accomplishment or the completion of an important task. Success states can also be an opportunity to give the user additional direction or actions to take.

## Anatomy

Each success state must have a **message**. It can also have a **call to action (CTA)** and an **illustration** to reinforce the message.

*<p class="text-center">Anatomy of UX illustration + message for SAP Fiori</p>*

**Illustration** <br />
The illustration helps clarify the situation and adds personality. It must always be paired with a message.

<br />

**Message** <br />
The message consists of a headline **and** description:
<ul><li>The headline explains the reason for the empty state, preferably in a single line.</li>
<li>The description adds details and tells the user what to do next, in three lines or less.</li>
</ul>

<br />

**Call to Action (CTA)** <br />
If there is a clear next step, include a CTA, ideally in the form of a button or link.

## Usage

Only use a UX illustration for a success state in notable positive situations, not for everyday or small tasks. If a UX illustration appears too often or for unimportant tasks, the user may feel the product is disingenuous, whereas you want to build trust. When designed appropriately through relatable, encouraging content, success states can enhance the user experience, add value, and be a quick UX win.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;">
<img src="./.vuepress/public/8b-SS-Fiori_moment_example@2x.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="UX illustration in a card image"/>
</div>

*<p class="text-center">UX illustration in a card</p>*

<Article description="If the user is working with a feature or application for the first time, use the success state to help onboard them or tell them how to populate the screen with content. Depending on your target audience, feel free to include some words of encouragement. For example, a well-placed encouragement can boost a new user’s confidence and make them feel positive about continuing." />

<br/>
<br/>

##### **Common Use Cases**
A success state can exist anywhere on the UI, such as a card, dialog, list, or table. They most commonly occur in the following situations:

<Borderedbox title="Important tasks" description="The user has completed an important task, like setting up their account or importing their data." />

<br/>

<Borderedbox title="Congratulations" description="The user is congratulated on an achievement or special milestone, for example, winning a contract or earning a promotion." />

<br/>

<Borderedbox title="Recognition and appreciation" description="The user receives appreciation for their work, for example, a note of thanks or a monetary reward." />

<br/>
<br/>

##### **When to Include an Illustration**

You’ve probably heard the adage A picture can tell a thousand words. When appropriate, use an illustration paired with a message to help celebrate a situation. Not all success states require an illustration, but it’s a great way to convey the meaning of the message more immediately and show the Fiori personality through the distinctive visual language that is shared by all UX illustrations. You can find recommended pairings of illustrations and messages in the [Use Case Library for Success States](./success-states.html#use-case-library).

If an illustration doesn’t enhance or contribute to the understanding of the situation, don’t use it.

## Best Practices

##### **Illustrations**
<br />
<TableCards img1="8c-SS-illustrations_Do@2x.png" alt1="SS-Illustration_Do" description1="Make sure the illustration, message, and CTA clarify the situation as one complete thought. <br /><br /> Use the right size illustration for the context. Check the links below for layout and spacing specifications. <br /><br/> For a more moderate positive situation, we recommend the checkmark with or without the confetti expression marks. This can be used more regularly (for example, new feature announcements, wizard flows, etc.). For everyday or insignificant success states, use a success dialog or message box as described in the <a href='https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/' target='_blank'>SAP Fiori Design Guidelines.</a>" img2="8c-SS-illustrations_Dont@2x.png" alt2="SS-Illustration_Dont" description2="Don’t use hyperlinks in the headline or description; they will be confusing. <br /><br /> Don’t use this tone repeatedly over a short space of time. It can otherwise sound insincere. <br/><br/> Don’t repeat the headline in the CTA."/>

<br />
<br />

##### **Messages**
<br />
<TableCards img1="8d-SS-Messages_Do@2x.png" alt1="SS-Messages_Do" description1="Make the headline and description brief and positive. Personalize the message if you can. The headline should be a single thought on one line; certainly no more than two lines. The description should be three lines or less. If you’ve not already briefly described the success in the headline, describe it in the description, for example, so that the user knows that they’ve done the right thing.<br /><br />Since success states are celebratory, be upbeat in tone. Craft a message that is cheerful and affirming. It should communicate our Fiori personality (Relatable, Smart, Encouraging, and Trusted). <br /> <br /> Encourage the user to perform an action, where appropriate. If there is a clear next step, include a CTA, ideally in the form of a button or link. But be sure that the user has permission for the next step. If you’re not certain, or if there is no clear next step, consider a more universal CTA, or none at all." img2="8d-SS-Messages_Dont@2x.png" alt2="SS-Message_Dont" description2="Don’t use hyperlinks in the headline or description; they will be confusing. <br /><br />Don’t use this tone repeatedly over a short space of time. It can otherwise sound insincere.<br /> <br/>Don’t repeat the headline in the CTA." />

<br />
<br />

##### **Grammar and Punctuation**
<br />
<TableCards img1="7c-ES-Grammar_Do@2x.png" alt1="" description1="Use sentence case for your headline and description. If the headline is a single sentence, omit the period at the end of the sentence. If the headline is two sentences, add a period at the end of each sentence. End each sentence in the description with a period “.” <br /> <br /> Use exclamation points sparingly. Use them only to be encouraging, not negatively. It’s okay to use exclamation points in headlines like ”Almost there!“ (to show progress during a process), but use them appropriately." img2="7c-ES-Grammar_Dont@2x.png" alt2="" description2="Don’t use BLOCK CAPITALS unless you’re referring to a label on the screen that is in block capitals. Users don’t like to feel they’re being shouted at. <br/><br/> Don’t use exclamation points for everyday situations like “You set up your account!” And don’t use multiple exclamation points!!!" />
<br />

<Article description="Ask your user assistance (UA) developer to review your messages before development close. If a message or illustration is changed, work with your UA developer to keep the message and illustration in sync." />

## Design & Layout

**Types and Sizing**

The UX illustration library is designed in three sizes to work within a variety of UI elements or controls:

<img src="./.vuepress/public/9-SS-Spot_specs@2x.png" alt="Spot Specs image" width="800px" height="390px" />

*<p class="text-center">**Spot (small):** For medium-sized cards or card-like UI elements </p>*

<img src="./.vuepress/public/9-SS-Dialog_specs@2x.png" alt="Dialog Specs image" width="800px" height="542px" />

*<p class="text-center">**Dialog (medium):** For dialogs </p>*

<br/>

<img src="./.vuepress/public/7d-ES-Scene_specs@2x.png" alt="ES scene image" width="800px" height="725px" />

<br/>

*<p class="text-center">**Scene (large):** For full-page or large UI areas, such as search, list, or table pages </p>*

<br />
<Article description="We're expanding our illustration library to accommodate more use cases. As we grow the library, we plan to add more sizes to reflect product needs and use cases." />

<br />
<br />

##### **Typeface**

Use typeface 72 and follow the SAP Fiori typography guidelines for the headline and description.

## Accessibility

Although illustrations are not essential for users to understand the content and purpose of the paired message, they should be announced by screen readers. This requires an alternative text which needs to be set by the product team.

<Article description="Don’t include text in illustrations. Screen readers are unable to read text that is part of an image." />

## Use Case Library

Here you’ll find the illustrations and recommended messages for success states, as well as the code to implement them. The messages and illustrations are consistent with the conversational tone of the SAP Fiori personality. Be sure to adapt the message to the target audience and situation.

<Article description="The code examples here assume the illustration SVG files are included in the page. If the illustrations are referenced externally, the use  xlink:href attribute must point to the file. For more information, see the <a href='https://github.tools.sap/sap-design-ops/fiori-moments/blob/master/README.md' target='_blank'>GitHub README</a>. <br/><br /> Please don’t hack the illustrations or modify them. We’re working on a way for you to contribute to the illustration library, so that we can scale the library more quickly, and yet maintain a consistent look and feel. See also <a href='./illustrations.html#creating-your-own-illustrations'>Creating Your Own Illustrations</a>. However, please contact <a href='mailto:naomi.yung@sap.com'>Naomi Yung</a> with your needs before creating an illustration. Also check our <a href='./status.html'>Component Status</a> page to see if we have a design or use-case in the pipeline." />

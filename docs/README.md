## UX Illustrations for SAP Fiori
##### **What are UX Illustrations for SAP Fiori?**
They are a recommended combination of a solution-oriented message, engaging illustration, and conversational tone to better communicate an empty state or success state than just a message alone. Empty states are moments in the user experience when there’s no content to display. Success states are occasions to celebrate and reward a user’s special accomplishment or the completion of an important task.

Appealing illustrations paired with solution-oriented messaging support the goals of SAP Fiori by making the user experience more enjoyable and meaningful, while ensuring consistency. Through this human-centered approach we can help to create a deeper connection with users because users feel understood and valued.
